# Unity 6 Best Practices

This document outlines key best practices for developing with Unity 6 in the CZGAME project.

## Performance Optimizations

### Entity Component System (ECS)

Unity 6 has improved ECS support that should be leveraged for performance-critical systems:

```csharp
// Example of ECS-based enemy spawning system
public class EnemySpawningSystem : SystemBase
{
    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        // Process entities in parallel
        Entities
            .WithAll<SpawnerTag>()
            .ForEach((ref SpawnPointComponent spawner, in Transform transform) => {
                spawner.SpawnTimer -= Time.DeltaTime;
                if (spawner.SpawnTimer <= 0)
                {
                    // Reset timer and spawn enemy
                    spawner.SpawnTimer = spawner.SpawnInterval;
                    // Request enemy spawn via pooling system
                }
            })
            .ScheduleParallel();
    }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use ECS for systems with many similar entities
- Combine ECS with object pooling for optimal performance
- Prefer Burst-compatible code where possible

### Burst Compiler

Unity 6's Burst compiler can significantly improve performance for math-heavy operations:

```csharp
[BurstCompile]
private void CalculateTrajectories(NativeArray<Vector3> positions, NativeArray<Vector3> velocities, float deltaTime)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < positions.Length; i++)
    {
        velocities[i] += Physics.gravity * deltaTime;
        positions[i] += velocities[i] * deltaTime;
    }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Mark appropriate methods with `[BurstCompile]`
- Use NativeArrays and NativeContainers for Burst-compatible data
- Avoid managed objects in Burst-compiled code

### Graphics Performance

Unity 6's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) offers significant performance improvements:

**Best Practices:**
- Use the URP Asset to configure global quality settings
- Implement custom shaders using Shader Graph rather than legacy shaders
- Utilize URP's scriptable render features for custom post-processing

## Scripting Improvements

### C# 9 Features

Unity 6 supports C# 9 features that can improve code quality:

```csharp
// Record types for immutable data
public record PlayerStats(int Health, int Mana, float MovementSpeed);

// Init-only properties
public class Enemy
{
    public string EnemyType { get; init; }
    public int BaseHealth { get; init; }
}

// Pattern matching improvements
public bool IsHighValueTarget(Enemy enemy) => enemy switch
{
    { EnemyType: "Boss", BaseHealth: > 500 } => true,
    { EnemyType: "Elite" } => true,
    _ => false
};
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use records for data that shouldn't change after creation
- Leverage pattern matching for cleaner conditional logic
- Use init-only properties for objects that should be immutable after construction

### UniTask Integration

Unity 6 works well with UniTask for improved async/await support:

```csharp
public async UniTaskVoid LoadGameResourcesAsync()
{
    // Loading multiple resources in parallel
    var loadTasks = new[]
    {
        LoadPlayerDataAsync(),
        LoadLevelDataAsync(),
        LoadAudioAsync()
    };
    
    await UniTask.WhenAll(loadTasks);
    
    // All resources loaded, continue game initialization
    InitializeGame();
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use UniTask instead of standard Tasks for Unity-aware async operations
- Avoid blocking the main thread with synchronous operations
- Use cancellation tokens for operations that might need to be abandoned

## Memory Management

### Managed Memory

Unity 6 has improved garbage collection, but it's still important to minimize allocations:

**Best Practices:**
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Implement structs instead of classes for small, short-lived data
- Avoid allocations in performance-critical code paths (Update, FixedUpdate)

```csharp
// Before: Allocates a new array each time
private void HighAllocationMethod()
{
    Vector3[] points = new Vector3[100];
    // Use points...
}

// After: Reuses the same array
private Vector3[] sharedPoints = new Vector3[100];
private void LowAllocationMethod()
{
    // Use sharedPoints...
}
```

### Native Memory

For high-performance systems, consider using native memory:

```csharp
public void ProcessLargeDataSet(int size)
{
    // Allocate native memory
    NativeArray<float> data = new NativeArray<float>(size, Allocator.TempJob);
    
    try
    {
        // Process data...
    }
    finally
    {
        // Always dispose native memory
        data.Dispose();
    }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always dispose native allocations using `try-finally` or `using` statements
- Choose appropriate allocator types (Temp, TempJob, Persistent)
- Consider using NativeContainers for performance-critical data structures

## Physics System

Unity 6 introduces improvements to the physics systems:

**Best Practices:**
- Use 2D physics for 2D games (as in CZGAME)
- Implement composite colliders for complex static geometry
- Configure layer collision matrix to minimize unnecessary collision checks
- Use the new Physics2D Profiler module to identify bottlenecks

```csharp
// Efficient collision layer setup
public void ConfigureCollisionLayers()
{
    // Only check collisions between relevant layers
    Physics2D.SetLayerCollisionMask(LayerMask.NameToLayer("Player"), 
        LayerMask.GetMask("Enemy", "Environment", "Pickups"));
    
    Physics2D.SetLayerCollisionMask(LayerMask.NameToLayer("Enemy"), 
        LayerMask.GetMask("Player", "Environment", "Projectile"));
}
```

## UI System

Unity 6 has enhanced UI performance:

**Best Practices:**
- Use UI Toolkit for complex UIs
- For UI Elements, use USS (UI Stylesheet) for consistent styling
- Implement UI Document components for modular UI architecture
- For legacy UI, continue using Canvas-based approach with pooling

## Asset Pipeline

Unity 6's improved asset pipeline offers several optimization opportunities:

**Best Practices:**
- Enable Asset Pipeline V2 for faster asset imports
- Use sprite atlases for 2D textures
- Implement addressable assets for dynamic content loading
- Configure appropriate compression settings for each platform

## Testing

Unity 6 offers improved testing capabilities:

**Best Practices:**
- Write Play Mode tests for gameplay systems
- Implement Edit Mode tests for utility functions and non-runtime code
- Use Test Runners for continuous integration
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing

```csharp
[Test]
public void PlayerTakesDamage_HealthReduces()
{
    // Arrange
    var player = new GameObject().AddComponent<PlayerHealth>();
    player.MaxHealth = 100;
    player.CurrentHealth = 100;
    
    // Act
    player.TakeDamage(25);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(75, player.CurrentHealth);
}
```

## Project Organization

For Unity 6 projects, follow these organization best practices:

- Use Assembly Definitions to create clear boundaries between systems
- Organize scripts by domain (refer to Project Structure document)
- Implement ScriptableObject-based configuration
- Maintain separate folders for different asset types (Models, Textures, Audio, etc.)

## Migration Notes

When migrating older code to be Unity 6 compatible:

- Replace deprecated API calls with Unity 6 equivalents
- Convert legacy particle systems to Visual Effect Graph where appropriate
- Upgrade shaders to URP-compatible versions
- Update serialization methods to handle version differences
