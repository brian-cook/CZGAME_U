# Pull Request: Fix Method Override Issues in Enemy Classes

## Description
This PR fixes method override issues in the Swift Enemy controller where methods were being overridden without the base class methods being marked as virtual. 

## Changes Made
- Added `virtual` keyword to the following methods in `BaseEnemy.cs`:
  - `TakeDamage(int damage)`
  - `TakeDamage(int damage, DamageType damageType)`
  - `OnSpawn()`
  - `OnDespawn()`

- These methods can now be properly overridden in derived classes like `SwiftEnemyController`

## Issue Fixed
The following compilation errors have been resolved:
```
Assets\_Project\Scripts\Core\Enemy\SwiftEnemyController.cs(315,30): error CS0506: 'SwiftEnemyController.TakeDamage(int)': cannot override inherited member 'BaseEnemy.TakeDamage(int)' because it is not marked virtual, abstract, or override

Assets\_Project\Scripts\Core\Enemy\SwiftEnemyController.cs(329,30): error CS0506: 'SwiftEnemyController.TakeDamage(int, DamageType)': cannot override inherited member 'BaseEnemy.TakeDamage(int, DamageType)' because it is not marked virtual, abstract, or override

Assets\_Project\Scripts\Core\Enemy\SwiftEnemyController.cs(381,30): error CS0506: 'SwiftEnemyController.OnSpawn()': cannot override inherited member 'BaseEnemy.OnSpawn()' because it is not marked virtual, abstract, or override

Assets\_Project\Scripts\Core\Enemy\SwiftEnemyController.cs(402,30): error CS0506: 'SwiftEnemyController.OnDespawn()': cannot override inherited member 'BaseEnemy.OnDespawn()' because it is not marked virtual, abstract, or override
```

## Technical Details
The `BaseEnemy` class implements the `IDamageable` and `IPoolable` interfaces, which define the `TakeDamage`, `OnSpawn`, and `OnDespawn` methods. To allow proper polymorphic behavior, these methods needed to be marked as `virtual` in the base class.

## Testing Done
- Verified that all method implementations are correctly using the `override` keyword
- Verified that all overridden methods call the base implementation
- Reviewed implementation details to ensure proper behavior is maintained

## Related Documentation
- Updated method documentation to indicate these methods can be overridden
- Follows C# method inheritance best practices
- Follows Unity component inheritance patterns
