# AGENT RULES COMPLIANCE

## Overview
This rule defines the mandatory compliance process for all AGENT operations in the codebase.

## Priority
CRITICAL - 

!!! ensure that you review all project files.

!!! Do not make assumptions.

## Process
1. Pre-Operation Checks:
   - Review all rules in [ai_rules.json](mdc:Documentation/Guidelines/ai_rules.json)
   - Verify AGENT compliance with each rule category:
     * File Verification (Critical)
     * Cursor First Operations (Critical)
     * Cursor Integration (Critical)
     * Unity Compliance with current version (unity 6 - 6000.0.38f1) (Highest)
     * Technical Standards (Critical)
     * Project Alignment (Critical)
     * Error Handling (Critical)
     * Documentation (Critical)
     * Workspace Settings (Critical)
     * Implementation Tracking (Critical)
     * Implementation Requirements (Critical)
     * Interaction Personalization (Critical)
 

2. During Operation:
   - Maintain active AGENT compliance with all rules
   - Track modifications against requirements
   - Document changes in accordance with guidelines
   - Follow proper tool usage patterns

3. Post-Operation Verification:
   - Verify changes against all AGENT rule requirements
   - Ensure documentation is updated
   - Validate technical standards compliance
   - Confirm workspace integrity

## Conflict Resolution
If a rule conflicts with Unity/package best practices:
1. Document the conflict
2. Explain the best practice recommendation
3. Propose a solution that maintains compliance while following best practices
4. Request clarification if needed

## Reference Files
- Primary: [ai_rules.json](mdc:Documentation/Guidelines/ai_rules.json)
- Supporting:
  * [project_dependencies.md](mdc:Documentation/Resources/project_dependencies.md)
  * [version_troubleshooting.md](mdc:Documentation/Resources/version_troubleshooting.md)
  * [infrastructure.txt](mdc:Documentation/Guidelines/infrastructure.txt)
  * [performance_guidelines.txt](mdc:Documentation/Guidelines/performance_guidelines.txt)

## Implementation Requirements
1. Every AGENT response must:
   - Follow all rules in ai_rules.json
   - Document AGENT compliance with each relevant rule
   - Maintain proper versioning and dependencies
   - Use appropriate tools and patterns
   - Respect workspace structure and settings

2. All code changes must:
   - Be implemented through Cursor when possible
   - Follow Unity 6.0 best practices
   - Maintain project architecture
   - Include proper error handling
   - Update relevant documentation

3. All tool operations must:
   - Respect tool limitations
   - Follow proper calling patterns
   - Maintain workspace integrity
   - Track modifications appropriately

## Validation
Before completing any operation, verify:
1. All relevant rules have been followed
2. Changes comply with project standards
3. Documentation is complete and accurate
4. Technical requirements are met
5. Workspace integrity is maintained
